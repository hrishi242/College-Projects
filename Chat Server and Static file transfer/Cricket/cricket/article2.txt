Grace Harris will replace Darcie Brown for the ODI leg of Australia's forthcoming tour of Bangladesh, the country's cricket board announced on Friday (March 15). Brown was ruled out of the series with a navicular stress injury to her left foot. A timeline for her recovery and return will be ascertained in due course.
Harris was originally named for just the T20I leg of the tour and will now have to leave sooner to join the rest of the squad. Her assignment in the WPL has already ended with her team UP Warriorz failing to make it past the league phase.
The ODI squad, announced previously, has a notable absentee in Jess Jonassen, who was omitted from the squad. Fast bowler Tayla Vlaeminck will make her much-awaited return following a spell on the sidelines with injury. All-rounder Heather Graham was originally placed on the standby list for the tour. She will, now, not travel owing to an illness.

The series kicks off on March 21 with the teams scheduled to play three ODIs and three T20Is. This will be Australia's first bilateral series in Bangladesh and will help them prepare for the T20 World Cup that is scheduled to be held there in September.
